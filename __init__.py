cf-view is a graphical user interface that is used for analysing and plotting netCDF and Met Office format atmospheric data. It uses the Climate and Forecast conventions hence the CF in the name.  One of the main features of cf-view is that it produces cf-python and cf-plot Python code that can be used from the Python command line and modified to further enhance data analysis and plots in batch mode.
