For now, please see the static cf-view documentation hosted at 
[http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-view](http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-view)
(`http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-view`), noting that soon the canonical location for the
full documentation will be moved to be under the NCAS-CMS organisation space, at
`https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-view/build/index.html` (these pages do not currently exist).
