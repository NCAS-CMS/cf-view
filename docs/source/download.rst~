Download/Install
****************

To install cf-view
==================

Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux if this is not already installed. The following will work on a more recent version of Linux i.e. Mint 17:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c conda-forge -c jochym cf-python=1.5.4.post6 cf-plot=1.9.29 cf-view pygobject2 pygtk pango libiconv pcre



cf-view is also available as an install using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot
   pip install cf-view


cfview dependencies are pygtk, Numpy, Matplotlib, Netcdf4 and Basemap and these will also need to be installed before using cfview.


To run cf-view
==============

::

   cfview <optional netCDF, Met Office PP or fields file(s)>



Possible missing zlib error
===========================

If you get a libz.so.1: version `ZLIB_1.2.9' not found error then you'll need to compile and link in this version of zlib:

Download https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.2.9/zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz/download
tar 
cd zlib-1.2.9.tar
mkdir ~myzlib
./configure --prefix=~/myzlib
make
make install

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/myzlib::LD_LIBRARY_PATH
