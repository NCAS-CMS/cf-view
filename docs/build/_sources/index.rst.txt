**Exploration & plotting GUI for netCDF & Met Office format data**

########
Overview
########

cf-view is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for earth science and
aligned research which supports the exploration, analysis and plotting
of netCDF and Met Office format (PP or fields) data.

It is intended to be an updated replacement and improvement on the
`xconv+ <https://ncas-cms.github.io/xconv-doc/html/index.html>`__ tool,
using the power of:

-  Python (`PyQt <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/>`__)
   for the GUI;
-  `cf-plot <https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-plot>`__ (building on top of
   `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ and
   `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`__) for the
   plotting;
-  `cf-python <https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/>`__ for the data
   reading, processing and analysis; and
-  `cfdm <https://ncas-cms.github.io/cfdm/>`__ for the underlying data
   model.

It is designed to be a useful tool for environmental, earth and aligned
sciences, for example to facilitate climate and meteorological research.
cf-view is developed and maintained by the
`NCAS-CMS <https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/index.html>`__ group, part of
`NCAS <https://ncas.ac.uk/>`__.


Features
^^^^^^^^

With cf-view you can, in a self-contained specialised GUI environment:

- Inspect, analyse and manipulate field constructs and their data;
- Edit, delete and create field metadata and properties;
- Output the underlying cf-python and cf-plot code;
- View and produce plots such as map, contour, zonal means, vector, line and
  trajectory plots;
- Change plotting properties such as map, colour scale, contour levels and
  vector properties; and
- Change interface colour scheme, fonts and font sizes.

Future releases will add support for data:

- with 2D dimensions;
- defined on rotated pole grids;
- defined on unstructured grids i.e. UGRID data.


##########
Quickstart
##########

After installing (see below), start cf-view through the command line via
running:

.. code-block:: bash

   cfview

or if you wish to start working with a specific file, add a positional
argument:

.. code-block:: bash

   cfview <file>

where ``<file>`` is the path to the netCDF, Met Office PP or fields
file.

*Note:* when starting cf-view for the first time, it might take twenty
or so seconds to start while matplotlib does some initialisation work.


############
Installation
############

There are two main ways to install cf-view: through a package manager,
or by downloading and running a dedicated installation script.

Installation by package manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use ``pip`` with ``conda`` (or similar package managers such as
``mamba``) as follows.

To use ``pip``, run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install cf-python cf-plot cf-view

In future you will be able to install cf-view and all of its
dependencies fully with ``conda``, but for now only the dependencies are
installable this way, like so:

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c ncas -c conda-forge cf-python cf-plot udunits2

and you must use e.g.Â ``pip`` to install the cf-view library itself.

Installation by download script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, to install cf-view with its required dependencies, you
can download from source. For Linux, run:

.. code:: bash

   wget http://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/ncas_climate/ajh/cfview_install/cfview_install.sh

or for Mac, instead run:

.. code:: bash

   curl -O -L http://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/ncas_climate/ajh/cfview_install/cfview_install.sh

and then install by running the ``cfview_install.sh`` script, for
example with:

.. code:: bash

   bash cfview_install.sh

Further installation information

(``https://ajheaps.github.io/cf-view/download.html``) of the
documentation.
