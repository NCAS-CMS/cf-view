To install cf-view
==================

Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux if this is not already installed. The following will work on a more recent version of Linux i.e. Mint 17:

::

    conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot cf-view
    conda install -c jochym pygobject2 pygtk pango
    conda install -c trung libiconv
    conda install -c conda-forge pcre  



cf-view is also available as an install using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot
   pip install cf-view


cfview dependencies are pygtk, Numpy, Matplotlib, Netcdf4 and Basemap and these will also need to be installed before using cfview.

   cfview <optional netCDF, Met Office PP or fields file(s)>
